# OASW-Quiz-site
 Quiz site for an OASW anti-Asian racism training. The host controls the flow of the quiz while participants answer questions within a time limit.  
 While multiple participants can take part in the quiz, a single instance of the host controls must be opened to start/stop the timer and advance the quiz.

Participants' answers are highlighted and can be changed until the timer either runs out or is manually stopped by the host. On timer expiry, participant answers remain highlighted, the incorrect answers' backgrounds are changed to red, and a graph showing the percentage of participants who gave each answer is displayed.

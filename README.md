# OASW-Quiz-site
 Quiz site for an OASW anti-Asian racism training. The host controls the flow of the quiz while participants answer questions within a time limit.  
 While multiple participants can take part in the quiz, a single instance of the host controls must be opened to start/stop the timer and advance the quiz.
